%% this file is supposed to run the CFD code and return forces to the mooring model
%   inputs: xyz coordinates of moorning model
%  outputs: forces (at center of mass of bodies, and at mooring line 'segments')
%           moments about local coordinate system of mooring 'bodies'

% note: danny add OPTIONS to configSimple.m
